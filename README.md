## Stamp-Project

This is my first self directed exercise in AngularJS. Maybe NodeJS too, we'll see how it works out.

This project was founded out of frustration with the store and stamp pages of the canada post website. It aims to provide advanced search sort and filtering for 
current Canadian stamps.

###Basic Capabilities
  *Sort and filter stamps by:
  
    *size
    
    *price
    
    *format
    
    *release date
    
    *availability

###Possible Future Expansion
  *Add support for other postal services
  *integrate a more useful cart structure for shopping
